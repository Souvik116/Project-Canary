# Project-Canary

Project Canary is a survival horror game made using the Unreal Engine. 
The story follows a 30 something D. McKee, who is a famous horror storywriter; living in Stockshire. 
He's mysterious, sarcastic and sharp tongued, traits that he developed as a consequence of coping with his past. The player will have ample opportunity to uncover the same through the course of the game. 

During an otherwise normal day, our protagonist abruptly starts seeing eerie phenomenon, steadily creeping into his otherwise normal life. Tormented by these strange occurrences and convenient “coincidences”, McKee decides to follow the trail, not just figuratively.
Thus semi-enlightened to the underlyings and workings of the world he embarks on a rather singular journey to see the end of it.

Project Canary’s story is furnished with brain-racking puzzle and an ample serving of easter eggs and references (the name of the game being the first).
The story will be a sort of an allegory suiting a general casual audience as well as a lore-centric, mesmerized audience.
There are several puzzle mechanics that the player must understand and master in order to get to the end of McKee’s trail and find answers to the questions that he is so desperately seeking.
